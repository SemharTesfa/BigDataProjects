# Big Data Projects

Welcome to the `BigDataProjects` repository, which contains a series of detailed projects focusing on big data technologies, analysis techniques, and machine learning applications. This repository is structured to provide hands-on experience and practical insights into handling and analyzing large datasets.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each corresponding to specific projects and workshops that cover various aspects of big data processing and analysis.

### Assignments

Each assignment directory contains files and scripts associated with different stages of big data analysis:

- **A1**: Basics of data handling and initial processing.
  - `a1.txt`: Text file with introductory notes and results.

- **A2**: Advanced data processing and analytics.
  - `a2.txt`: Documented analysis results.
  - `combined_replies.txt`: Combined datasets from multiple sources.
  - `replies.txt`: Sample dataset of replies for analysis.

- **A3**: Real-time data streaming and processing applications.
  - `a3.txt`: Summary and outcomes from streaming data analysis.

- **A4**: Deep learning applications in big data.
  - `a4.txt`: Overview of applying deep learning models.
  - `cs131_A4_plots.pdf`: Charts and plots demonstrating model results.

- **A5**: Visualization and data representation for effective storytelling.
  - `a5.txt`: Instructions and scripts for data visualization.

- **A6**: Capstone project integrating techniques from all previous assignments.
  - `A6.ipynb`: Comprehensive Jupyter notebook detailing the project.
  - `A6_pdf.pdf`: Complete project report in PDF format.

### Workshops

Workshops provide practical examples and real-time problem-solving experiences:

- **WS1 - WS6**: Contains logs, scripts, and command histories from each workshop session, showcasing practical usage of big data tools.

  - Example for Workshop 1:
    - `cmds2.log`: Log file with all executed commands.

## Installation and Setup

To set up the environment to run the projects, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
